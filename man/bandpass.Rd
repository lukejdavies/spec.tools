%- Also NEED an '\alias' for EACH other topic documented here.
\title{
Return either the spectral flux convolved with a given filter, or total luminosity within a filter
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
bandpass(spec, filter, lum = T)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{spec}{
List of the same form as generated by get.spec
}
  \item{filter}{
Filter response to convolve spectrum with. Of the format produced by 'getfilt'
}
  \item{lum}{
Should total flux in the band be calulated? TRUE/FALSE 
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
If lum==F returns a vector of the same size as spec$flux, but comvovled with the filter response
If lum==T returns a scalar of the total flux in the passband
